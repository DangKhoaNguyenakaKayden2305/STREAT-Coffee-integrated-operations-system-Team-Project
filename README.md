**STREAT Integrated Operations Management System (IOMS)**

Business IT Systems Review & Solution Design for a Multi-Site Social Enterprise

**Project Overview**

STREAT is a Melbourne-based Work-Integrated Social Enterprise (WISE) operating 11 cafés, a catering business, a bakery, and a coffee roastery, while delivering youth employment and training programs.
Despite its strong social mission, STREAT faced significant operational challenges caused by fragmented systems, manual processes, and delayed reporting.

This project reviewed STREAT’s existing technology landscape, identified business and operational pain points, and designed a scalable, integrated operations management solution to support:

Real-time inventory visibility

Faster financial and operational reporting

Improved cost control and decision-making

Long-term scalability aligned with STREAT’s social mission

**Business Problem**

Through stakeholder engagement and system analysis, the key issues identified were:

Disconnected platforms (Square, Xero, Shopify, FoodStorm, Deputy, Excel)

Manual Excel-based inventory and recipe costing

Financial reporting delays of up to 6 weeks

Limited real-time visibility across 11 café locations

High reliance on individual knowledge → scalability risk

**These issues limited STREAT’s ability to make timely, data-driven decisions and increased operational risk.**

**Stakeholders**

Cass Godden – Chief Systems / Operations Officer

Greg Edelmaier – Chief Finance Officer

Café Managers & Operational Staff

Finance & Accounting Team

Board Members & External Funders

Stakeholder needs were gathered through direct consultation, requirement validation, and iterative clarification.

**My Role, Business Analyst**

I acted as a Business Analyst within a cross-functional team, serving as a bridge between business stakeholders and the technical solution.

My key BA responsibilities included:

**🔹 Stakeholder engagement**

Worked directly with senior stakeholders (CSO & CFO)

Clarified business objectives, constraints, and reporting needs

Translated high-level goals into structured requirements

**🔹 Requirements analysis & documentation**

Identified current-state system gaps and unsupported processes

Contributed to client & stakeholder requirement matrices

Ensured alignment between business needs and solution design

**🔹 Business process modelling (BPMN)**

Personally designed and refined BPMN diagrams

Modelled end-to-end processes for:

Inventory management

Purchase orders

Recipe costing

Operational dashboards

Used BPMN to communicate clearly with technical team members

Contributed to Power BI dashboard design

Ensured KPIs reflected real stakeholder decision-making needs

Focused on usability for non-technical users

**🔹 Team collaboration**

Worked closely with solution consultants, researchers, and PM

Participated in weekly stand-ups, workshops, and reviews

Helped align technical design with real operational workflows

**Teamwork & Collaboration**

This was a team-based consulting style project.
Success depended on communication, coordination, and shared ownership.

Weekly team meetings and sprint planning

Clear division of roles with strong cross-checking

Constructive discussions when requirements were unclear

Collaborative refinement of BPMN, dashboards, and solution scope

The final solution reflects integrated thinking, not isolated individual work.

**Solution Overview**

We designed an Integrated Operations Management System (IOMS) that:

Preserves existing systems (Square, Xero, Shopify, FoodStorm)

Introduces a central data integration layer

Automates inventory, costing, and reporting workflows

Provides role-based dashboards for different stakeholders

Key Solution Components

Centralised data hub (real-time synchronisation)

Purchase Order management workflow

Real-time inventory tracking across locations

Automated recipe costing with margin alerts

Operational & financial analytics dashboards

**Power BI Dashboards (Decision-Focused)**

The dashboards were designed to support real business decisions, not just reporting.

Examples of insights provided:

Daily sales vs inventory movement by location

Live gross margin tracking by recipe

Cost variance alerts (>25% threshold)

Cross-location performance comparison

End-of-day reconciliation (replacing 6-week delays)

These dashboards enabled next-day action, instead of retrospective analysis.

**Business Process Modelling (BPMN)**

BPMN diagrams were used to:

Visualise current vs future-state processes

Reduce ambiguity between business and technical teams

Ensure workflows matched how STREAT actually operates

Support scalability and future system implementation

The BPMN artefacts became a shared language across the team.

**Business Value Delivered**
Area	Impact
Reporting speed	6 weeks → 1 day
Inventory visibility	Real-time, cross-location
Manual work	Significant reduction
Cost control	Live margin & cost alerts
Decision-making	Faster, data-driven
Scalability	Reduced reliance on individuals

Most importantly, the solution supports STREAT’s social mission by freeing staff time to focus on youth training and support, not manual admin work.
